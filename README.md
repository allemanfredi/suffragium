# Suffragium

Suffragium is a voting system that leverages zero-knowledge (zk) proofs and ‚ÄçFully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to preserve all essential properties of a secure voting system. It generates a zk proof, verifying that a registered user is eligible to vote after having completed the KYC. Additionally, it employs FHE (thanks to [zama](https://www.zama.ai/)) to prevent bribery and blackmail by ensuring that votes remain private and confidential. This voting system aims to simulate and enhance the current voting process by ensuring that users are properly authenticated while maintaining privacy and security. The system is currently still under development, with ongoing improvements to enhance its security and functionality.
